## Project Description
The Perfect Path is a Dungeons and Dragons inspired website that one can use customize a character's features and abilities. A user can search for keywords associated with certain spells, hero classes, and so on. Results are filtered based on keyword input. For example, if a user wants to find a certain for a level 5 spellcaster, the user can search for a spell by its name or description and spells that match those filters that their character can equip will be displayed. There is a login page, and the backend and database will store the current userâ€™s customized characters. The database will also be used to store the levels of certain users, and the level of a user will determine what abilities and features are available to that user.

## Getting Started
Frontend is located in application/src.            
Backend is located in application/server.            

### Required Technologies            
Install Node.js and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/ (Note: NPM is typically included with Node.js).            
Install Go from https://go.dev/dl/.            

### Initial Project Setup            
Run `git clone https://github.com/Charlene999/CEN3031-The-Perfect-Path.git` from a terminal or command line pathed into a designated folder.            
Change directory into the newly created CEN3031-The-Perfect-Path folder/application.             

### Frontend Setup                    
Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.                
Run `npm install`.                             
Run the frontend using the command `npm start` (Make sure you are within the application directory).            
            
### Backend Setup            
Change directory into server.            
Run `touch .env`.            
Enter the following three lines into the .env file and replace with your chosen SQL database information:            
&emsp;   `DB_USERNAME=replacethiswithdatabaseusername`            
&emsp;   `DB_PASSWORD=replacethiswithdatabasepassword`            
&emsp;   `TOKEN_SECRET=replacethiswithdatabasetokenpassword`            
Copy this .env file into application/server/test in addition to storing it in application/server.          
Run `go mod download`.           
Run the backend using the command `go run main.go` (Make sure you are within the application/server directory).            
Run backend tests using the command `go test backend/test` (Make sure you are within the application/server directory).
