## Description
It is a Dungeons and Dragons inspired website that one can use customize a character's features and abilities. A user can search for keywords associated with certain spells, hero classes, and so on. Results are filtered based on keyword input. For example, if a user wants to find a high damage ability for a level 5 spellcaster, the user will select high damage from a drop-down bar and results will appear for spells with optional filters for classes or domains and so on. There is a login page, and the backend will store the current userâ€™s customized characters.
